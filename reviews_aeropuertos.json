Unfortunately, the counters at check-in in Terminal A at Schonefeld were not like systems used by similar low-cost carriers at other airports, where several counters are used for the all flights of that airline at once. We had a counter and a Milan flight was currently using it. It wasn't for another hour that it finally opened. \r\n\r\nAt security it was a similar problem of cold war infrastructure. It took a further 10-15 minutes to get through to airside departures.

Benito Juarez is in dire straights.  \r\n\r\nThe airport is 24/7 but the transportation between the two terminals either isn't (the train certainly isn't) or too complicated (I speak Spanish and still can't figure out the intra-terminal bus) so if you're connecting at night and need to switch terminals, better grab a taxi.  \r\n\r\nThere's no wifi that's free to foreigners which is embarrassing.  There's a workaround but it's not great.  Basically there's 1 network (sorry I forget which) that you can connect to that is for Mexicans who subscribe to whatever cell phone company it is, when you don't have credentials to log in it still gives you like 5-15 minutes of internet connectivity by accident.  Worked for me on my MacBook, but not my iPhone.  I did this repeatedly to get things done.  With status I can use the lounge, but it's not open 24/7.\r\n\r\nI gave facilities 3 stars because they keep the place pretty clean at least at night, somehow I've never been there during the day.  There's 7-11/Circle K open 24/7 at both terminals, both have some decent indoor/outdoor seating, though you will always find people sleeping on the floor. Terminal 2 has a restaurant that's 24/7 as well that serves decent food and liquor (not sure what time liquor goes til) and it's not horribly expensive.  \r\n\r\nIf you've arrived after a long day of flying and still have some left, bring a change of clothes.  You won't find a cheap shower/hotel right here, so if you wanna leave not feeling like a dirt bag, a change of clothes REALLY helps.  \r\n\r\nIf you're taking the train between terminals beware of guys offering to help.  They don't work for the airport, or if they do, they aren't free.  I'm a physically capable young man who speaks Spanish and I was being offered some help to make the train, I thought oh great he's just one of those airport helper types.  Then he took my bag up the escalator...MY CARRYON 15lb bag...as if I couldn't do that?  Then he asked for a tip.  I get it, he's working...but I didn't need help, and I told him he didn't need to take my bag but he insisted.  Not only did I not want to tip him, but when I told him I had no pesos (I was connecting for 5 hours, why would I have local cash?) he said he accepts all currencies.  I had just come from Colombia, going home to Canada, I don't carry much if any cash in either country so all I had was plastic...he walked off in a big huff angry that he had wasted 5 minutes with me.  \r\n\r\nOverall this airport is a pretty miserable experience.  Signage can be extremely poor, again speaking Spanish I'm not sure if English is a problem here, I'd hope not, it's Mexico after all.  But anything other than English and you might be in trouble.  There's banks and currency exchanges open 24/7 but not that much else.  Service here is poor outside of the restaurant I spoke of.  It's also run down and being renovated...WHY?  You're already building a new airport so renovating duty free seems stupid.  Maybe they'll use this airport as an LCC one for VivaAirbus or something.  \r\n\r\nThe gates are a bit of a disaster too.  Everyone wants to use tiered boarding systems but the gates are too crammed to really accomplish that.  When AA, DL, AV and AC all have international flights departing within 15 minutes of each other in the same tiny corner of the airport, there's nowhere left to sit and boarding while quick, is chaotic.  With a big airfield taking off can take some time as well.  \r\n\r\nMy final complaint...customs and baggage claim.  Customs at Terminal 2 is nice, it's well lit, well divided, it's new, it's fairly quick.  Baggage claim is slow but I've seen worse areas to be standing in. \r\n\r\nTerminal 1 is literally a bunker in what feels like the basement of the airport.  There's support beams in the middle of the lineup and you're never quite sure if the building will collapse on your head.  There's no customs forms here, so you better hope you remembered to bring the one from on the plane.  It's also somewhat of a mad dash to get in here, because despite having full international flights arriving late at night there'll still only be 3-4 customs workers on shift...yet the duty free next to it has 4-5.  The lineup never seems to take THAT long, but I also make sure I'm never near the back of it.  \r\n\r\nAfter that baggage claim can be a chore.  It seemed to me normal connection rules for baggage don't apply here.  I was told not to pick up my bag, then security officials insisted I had to, then my bag didn't show up and they said it must've been lost, then upon talking to the airline, they said I didn't need to receive it.  Again, all of this was done in intermediate to high level Spanish, I know when I'm not understanding and this wasn't the case.\r\n\r\nConnecting at this airport, should be avoided if you can, ESPECIALLY if you're making a connection between 2 different airlines, or heaven forbid 2 different alliances.  Also check the wiki page because no all alliances stick to one terminal like normal. Copa (Star Alliance) is T2 while Lufty/AC/Avianca are all T1.  So making that connection means you need to retrieve your bags, transfer terminals (with train or not, depending on time of day) and re-check in on the other side.\r\n\r\nQUE MIERDAAAAA ese hpta aeropuerto!  \r\n\r\nI'm sure Mexico City is lovely, but the airport doesn't offer a good impression.

That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s without faults cause there\u2019s many! But if your coming to or from London... this is your best bet. It dosen\u2019t stack up to other European airports like Schipol, Luxembourg, Geneva or Paris CDG, and comes no where even remotely close to world class airports like Singapore Changi, Zurich or Munich. However it will get you from A-B with minimal hassle depending on luck. \r\n\r\nGetting to and from the airport is fairly easy with taxis and Uber\u2019s available. There is also busses and the Tube (your best bet) on the Piccadilly line straight from London. There are tube stops for Terminal 1,2&3, Terminal 4 and Terminal 5 so make sure you get off at the right one and beware, Terminals 1,2&3 is a long walk to any of the Terminals. Terminal 1 is closed however but Terminal 2 and 5 are the most modern and look nice clean and new with good architecture. Terminals 3 and 4 are slightly older but still very acceptable. In each terminal it is well signposted and depending on the time of day security and check in aren\u2019t too bad, but expect half an hour for both at worst. \r\n\r\nThe restaurant and shops situation is a double edged sword... while they are nice and luxury, I can\u2019t imagine many people can afford these places other than just look, and also who\u2019s buying a TV or a MacBook in an airport? The food situation isn\u2019t much better, most of the time you can only stomach a quick snack and it has to be takeaway. With the exception of a Pret A Manger, Costa, WHSmiths or Starbucks your only option is to have a sit down expensive meal. Signage is good, although only  in English. Announcers however do make announcements in English and the language of the country the said flight is traveling too. \r\n\r\nThe gates usually have enough seats although expect to stand if you are late. Staff are generally friendly and helpful. Sometimes you can breeze through and other times it can be really annoying. Also beware of where your gate is as sometimes it can be quite far away. This is especially important if you are in terminal 5, which has 2 satellite terminals (5B & 5C) which you need to take an underground train too which takes a further 15 minutes. You will know this if your gate starts with either a B or a C. In Terminal 5 if your gate is A23 then you are in the main terminal. If it\u2019s B23 or C23 then you have to take the train. European flights almost always tend to be in the main terminal as it\u2019s more important people get their fast. \r\n\r\nBeware if there is anything other than completely normal weather your flight could be delayed or cancelled... 1000s of flights get cancelled each year for the most pathetic reasons that would make the Swiss (like me), Norwegians, Canadians or Russians die with laughter. \r\n\r\nAll in all though it\u2019s a fairly decent airport and definitely your best bet in London by a mile...", "compound": 0.9961}, {"opinion": "Heathrow is a brilliant airport to fly out of, Check in is quick and easy, security is efficent and good quality lounges especially the BA Galleries North T5", "compound": 0.9001}, {"opinion": "I love London Heathrow and the only reason I dont give it 5 stars is because it is so large, to the point it feels a bit disjointed and can seem cumbersome with its size.
